    "**StarDist** is a deep learning-based instance segmentation tool specifically designed for objects with star-convex shapes (e.g., nuclei). Instead of using pixel-wise masks, **StarDist** predicts each object as a star-convex polygon, defined by a set of radial distances from the center.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key ideas:**\n",
    "- Designed for roundish or blob-like objects such as nuclei or cells.\n",
    "- Efficient and good at separating touching cells.\n",
    "- Outputs instance-wise masks, not just binary foreground-background.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conceptual Illustration:**\n",
    "Each object is represented as a star-shaped polygon radiating out from the center, making it particularly well-suited to objects with roughly circular or elliptical morphology."
