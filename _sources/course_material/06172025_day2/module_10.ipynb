    "**What is convolution?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Convolution** is a mathematical operation used to apply filters to images. A small matrix (called a kernel) slides over the image and performs a weighted sum of the pixel values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is it important in bioimage analysis?**\n",
    "Convolution enables operations such as smoothing (denoising) and edge detection, crucial for preparing images for further analysis (e.g., segmentation).\n",

    "- **Kernel/Filter:** Small matrix for transformation\n",
    "- **Stride:** Step size of the kernel movement\n",
